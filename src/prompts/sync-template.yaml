prompts:
  sync_template: |
    You are syncing the project "{{project}}" with the PilotLynx project template.

    Template directory: {{templateDir}}
    Project directory: {{projectDir}}

    Your tasks:
    1. Compare the project structure against the template.
    2. Identify missing files that should exist (like workflow skeletons, .gitkeep files).
    3. Identify structural issues (missing directories like memory/, artifacts/, logs/).
    4. Apply updates for missing structural files WITHOUT touching project-specific content:
       - Do NOT modify PROJECT_BRIEF.md, RUNBOOK.md, or memory/ files (these contain project data).
       - Do NOT overwrite CLAUDE.md if it has been customized.
       - DO add missing workflow skeletons if they don't exist.
       - DO add missing .gitkeep files.
       - DO ensure .mcp.json exists.
    5. Report what was added/updated and what was skipped.
